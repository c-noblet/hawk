# Hawk

Hawk is an apache2 vhost generator. It can generate vhosts by giving it a domain name and you can also choose to create a Wordpress project.

/!\ Be aware that this program was developed for my personal needs and must not be used in a production environment.

## Installation

Change the ```custom_path``` and the ```custom_user``` according your work environment.

```bash
# hawk.sh
custom_path="/"
custom_user="user:user"
 ```

## Upgrades to do

* Wordpress auto wp-config.php updater
* Wordpress auto database configuration
